                <h2>Range</h2>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p> Finding your vocal range is one of the most important things you can know about yourself as a singer.
                    That is because learning your vocal range will help you understand how low or high you can sing.
                    Vocal range is a measurement of distance from the lowest note to the highest note that a person can sing. Vocal range is very helpful in defining a singer’s voice type (Bass, Tenor, Alto, Soprano, for example), measuring vocal progress over time and choosing songs and repertoire that fit a singer’s voice.
                    The goal of Vocal training is to empower the singer with Consistency, Fluidity, and Mastery over the widest range of notes possible.
                    The overall range of the voice is split into different registers.
                    The aim of the vocalist is to navigate their entire range and sing as if it were one voice of consistent tonal quality.
                    
                    Vocal Fry
                    The rough and crackly vocal fry is the lowest of the vocal registers.it does not produce a full tone. Rather it is used as an effect in certain styles of singing.
                    
                    Chest voice
                    
                    The chest voice is the register in which most people speak throughout the day, and it produces the fullest tone of all the registers
                    
                    Middle voice
                    
                    The middle voice is not actually a unique register but rather a mixture of the resonance found in chest voice and head voice. 
                    Developing a strong middle voice enables you to navigate between chest and head voice with consistency and without the voice breaking.
                    Head voice 
                    The head voice is higher than the chest voice and produces a naturally lighter tone. 
                    Strengthening the head voice aids the tonal quality of the middle voice.

                <h2>Control</h2>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>Vocal control means mastering the basic foundations of singing and being able to apply them to your performances.
                    Vocal control has two parts:

                    1. Mastering singing fundamentals and

                    2. Applying them to your performances.

                    That means that you need to understand the fundamentals of singing and work with exercises to help you get there.

                <h2>Pitch</h2>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>Voice pitch is a frequency, uniform soundwaves attributed to a musical note. (Just like on a piano). What makes pitches of voice unique is how uniform the sound waves are of the tone and the frequency or pattern the pitch travels in.
                    The human ear picks up on the uniform frequency and recognizes it as a pitch or note.

                <br>
                <br>
                <p>Tone suggests your mood and your intention towards the listener, eg happy or sad.
                    
                    The human voice is an extremely expressive and versatile instrument and no 2 voices ever sound exactly the same 
                    Vocal tone describes the quality and characteristics of the voice.
